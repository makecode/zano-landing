    <h4>General information</h4>
    <p>Hyle team, a group of individuals behind the Zano project (the "Team," "we" or "us") is the operator of this website, together with zano.org, coinswap.zano.org or docs.zano.org (each a "website" and together, our "websites"). As the operator of the sites, we take the protection of your personal data very seriously.</p>
    <p>This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") will provide you with information about the collection, processing and use of your personal data when using our websites.</p>

    <h4>Data processing in connection with the sites</h4>
    <h4>Visiting our websites</h4>
    <p>When you visit our website, the hosting provider of our website, Digital Ocean Inc automatically collects and stores various information in so-called server log files that your browser transmits to us. The information/data mentioned is neither assigned to specific persons nor linked to data from other sources. The following technical data will be recorded by us, as usual with every connection with a web server, without your intervention, and stored by us until automatic deletion after no later than two days.</p>
    <h4>Use of Websites Cookies</h4>
    <p>The websites uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a computer system via an Internet browser. More detailed information on cookies and how they work can be found at: http://www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
    <p>Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the data subject from other Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified using the unique cookie ID.</p>
    <p>Through the use of cookies, the Team can provide the users of this website with more user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>
    <p>Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our websites users. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for users to utilize our websites. The websites user that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the websites is accessed, because this is taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system.</p>
    <p>You may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our websites by means of a corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, previously set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, it may not be possible to use all the functions of our websites.</p>
    <p>For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them, see our Cookie Policy.</p>

Google may also transfer this information to third parties if this is required by law or if third parties process this data on behalf of Google.</p>
    <p>Generally, before the data is transmitted to the provider, the IP address will be abbreviated by activating IP anonymization (anonymizeIP) on this website, within the member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and abbreviated there. In these cases, we provide contractual guarantees to ensure that Google Inc. maintains a sufficient level of data protection. According to Google Inc., under no circumstances will the IP address be associated with any other user-related data.
